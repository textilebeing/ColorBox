# ColorBox
---

**ColorBox** is a silly program I'm writing to practice my graphical python skills.


I'm currently using the Graphics50.py library, but will soon switch over to tkinter.

I will likely look back on this in a few years and cringe, but it's helpful for keeping me active coding while school's on break.
